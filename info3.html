<div id="details">
    <p>Dharamsala is located in the district of Kangra in Himachal Pradesh. What many people donâ€™t know is that there are two parts of the city. One is known as Lower Dharamshala, which is its commercial center and dotted with markets, courts and the famous Kotwali Bazaar, where you come across items of everyday use. Upper Dharamshala is home to Mcleodganj as well as other structures which remind you of its colonial past. The two different parts of the city have something different to offer. As a tourist, it offers you the opportunity to unwind and take in the beauty of the surroundings.

        The colossal snow dressed peaks of Dhauladhar Range overlook Dharamsala at all times. The much talked about Tibetan Buddhist culture can be seen at Mcleodganj, which is dominated largely by the Tibetan community. It is a suburb of the city, and is situated at an impressive height of 2,082 meters. Here, the main street is dotted with shops selling Tibetan arts & crafts, along with eateries that serve a variety of Tibetan dishes, from Thenthu to momos. Most of the market centers around the Tsuglagkhang Complex, which is the official home of the 14th Dalai Lama. Naturally, it is a pilgrimage site for Tibetan exiles. Tourists visit it to see the Dalai Lama, explore the museum, watch the monks debate and just revel in the positive vibes exuded by the place.</p>
